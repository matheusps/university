# Reactive TodoList

Reactive TodoList is a Angular 2 powered single page application developed by [Matheus P. Silva][matheus], that you can:

  - Add Tasks
  - Complete Tasks
  - Remove Tasks
  - See your progress

This application is an academic work for the discipline Information Systems.

### Tech

Technologies used by the Reactive TodoList app are:

* [Angular 2] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [SystemJS] - Module Bundler
* [Bootstrap 4] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [MDBootstrap] - Material design theme for Bootstrap
* [Sass] - CSS with superpowers
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - do i really need to explain that one?

And of course Reactive TodoList itself is open source with a [public repository][git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.

### Installation and Development
Reactive TodoList requires npm packages.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies, run gulp to compile from .scss to .css and start the server.

##### Running the app
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/matheusps/lab2-si-todo-list-angular2.git
$ cd lab2-si-todo-list-angular2
$ npm install

The app also uses Sass. To use sass smartly, compiling it in real time use this gulp task:

```sh
$ gulp watch-sass
```
